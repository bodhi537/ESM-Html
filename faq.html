			  <div class="em-c-accordion__body">
				<p class="faq_question">How is the contact type field used?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">Contact type is used to indicate "How" the incident was reported. </p>
				<p class="faq_question">How can you view tasks associated with an incident?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">You can scroll down on the incident page and find a tab “Incident Tasks” which list the tasks associated with the Incident ticket.
                    You can also add or modify any tasks in the incident ticket.</p>
				<p class="faq_question">What is the best practice to handle cases where incidents were previously converted to work orders?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">Resolve the Incident and categorize it as "User Request/Information/How-To” in the ‘Resolution Code’ field located in the 
					Resolution Information Tab </p>
				<p class="faq_question">If a High or Critical incident has breached the SLA, will the ticket escalate automatically?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">There is some capability to trigger notification to the Assignee and the group manager on time elapsed such as 
					50%, 75%, etc. But those notifications have not been turned on.
					Additionally user can manually escalate any incident ticket. Open the incident ticket -> click on top left 3 bars (just beside the incident number on the header) -> click Escalate with necessary business justification.</p>
				<p class="faq_question">What if no one responds to the incident within the SLA timeframe?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">If no one responds with the SLA timeframe, then the corresponding SLA will breach </p>
				<p class="faq_question">What is the difference between Save and Update?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">The basic functionality is the same. Save will allow you to remain on the same screen, but update takes you back to the 
					previous screen but update takes you back to the previously accessed SNOW page after saving the ticket. </p>
				<p class="faq_question">When are configuration items (CI) required to be entered?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">The CI is not mandatory at the time of incident task creation but is mandatory when closing the incident task but it is mandatory before closing the incident ticket. </p>
				<p class="faq_question">When a user creates an incident template, is it available to only themself or to everyone?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">The template is only available to the person who created it by default. You cannot publish it for everyone or cannot 
					mark it as global </p>
				<p class="faq_question">Is it possible to share a template with everyone and if so, how can this be done?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">Yes. The templates can be shared to groups and individuals but not globally.</p>
				<p class="faq_question">After an incident is resolved, how many days is it an option to reopen?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">Incident will be set as "Closed" after 14 days of its resolution. BMC setting was set to 30 days. </p>
				<p class="faq_question">Can users add groups to the watch list?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer"> A group can be add if that group has a distribution list/email. You cannot add 
					the group names as part of the watch list. </p>
				<p class="faq_question">Is there a limit to the number of records that can be exported?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">The limit is 10k records. </p>
				<p class="faq_question">What is the purpose of a child incident?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">If there are multiple users reporting the same issue, you are able to associate 
					incidents to one incident and call it the 'Parent' and call the earliest reported incident ticket as ‘Parent’. The updates added to the 
					parent incident will cascade to child incidents. That way, the support users are not having to manage multiple 
					incidents for the same issue. When you resole the Parent incident it will resolve the children.</p>
				<p class="faq_question">Can a user change the priority of an incident?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">No, they will have to change the impact or urgency which will then drive the priority. </p>
				<p class="faq_question">How can I track the number of reopened tickets?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">The user can create a report by using the filter to find how many have been reopened that day, week, month etc.</p>
				<p class="faq_question">If a ticket is transferred a different queue while in progress, will the SLA clock restart?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">The ticket will assume the corresponding SLA defined for that particular group it 
					has been transferred to. The Response SLA will re-start but the Resolution SLA will not.
					Additionally, the previous SLA might be updated as “Cancelled” or “Closed” based on the SLA definition for the team. </p>
				

<p class="faq_question">What if I can’t find my configuration item?</p> 
<p class="faq_answer">Select “CI not found” and this will allow you to continue forward with the incident.Please report the configuration item gap to CMDB team and get the CI record updated in CMDB.</p>
<p class="faq_question">What if a configuration item does not apply for my work area (i.e. AV technology)?</p> 
<p class="faq_answer">	Select “CI not applicable” /”CI not found” and ensure you complete the categorization fields. </p>
<p class="faq_question">What if I don’t know the device but the application, technical, business service?</p> 
<p class="faq_answer">You can select those services and if any application has a defined DBM record that will be synced to ServiceNow. For example, the application service for SharePoint is called “Microsoft SharePoint 2016 2016 - Production - APP-7421”.</p>
<p class="faq_question">Can I filter on configuration items?</p>
<p class="faq_answer">Yes, you can open the configuration item display and filter upon multiple fields (class, location, manufacturing, etc..) on a configuration item.</p>
<p class="faq_question">When is category/subcategory required?</p> 
<p class="faq_answer">During the incident ticket lifecycle. As a best practice, update the fields when the incident ticket is created. This ensures an early description of the incident can be captured for incident auto-routing and/or stewardship.
*Note – Moogsoft, ebonding, and/or API connections will not be required to populate these required fields on day 1. Overtime we will enable policies to enforce</p>
<p class="faq_question">How does the category selection work?</p>
<p class="faq_answer">When you select a category, a sub-category list will appear to pick the more granular subcategory.</p>

			  <!-- end em-c-accordion__header -->
			  <div class="em-c-accordion__body">
				<p class="faq_question">Who are the Major Incident Managers?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">The Major incident managers are the EOC group who will review and approve/reject the major incident 
					proposals.</p>
				<p class="faq_question">Are service organizations expected to propose an incident to a major incident and contact EOC and hence EOC handles the rest of the process?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">That is correct. Once it's acknowledged as major incident, then the communication tasks are updated and 
					triggered by the EOC.</p>
				<p class="faq_question">What are the required fields to a propose major incident?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">Only High or Critical (P1 or P2) Incidents can be proposed as Major. Outage (CI 
					Unavailability in BMC) and Affected Location (Areas in BMC) are mandatory to RESOLVE a Major Incident, but 
					incident can be proposed and promoted (accepted) without this information, but it would be desirable to have them. </p>
				<p class="faq_question">Is the ServiceNow outage record similar to CI Unavailability in BMC?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">That is correct. In BMC they are known as CI Unavailability, in SN they are Outages for that CI. </p>
				<p class="faq_question">Is there a difference in the SLA clock between Major and non-Major Incidents?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">There is no difference on SLA clock. SLA for P1 and P2 Priority stays the same whether it 
					is considered a MI or not.</p>
				<p class="faq_question">Does an incident have to be 'Proposed' first for it to be 'Promoted' by the major incident managers (MIM)? Or can the MIM directly promote it?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">Major Incident Manager can also create a major incident directly without having to wait for a proposal to promote. </p>
				<p class="faq_question">Who receives the automatic notifications when an outage is created for a Major Incident?</p>
				<p class="faq_answer">Everyone in team (Assigned Group) and Watchlist participants will receive an outage notification whether it is a planned or an 
					unplanned outage. Unless the user has opted out of receiving such notifications, they are sent to everyone.</p>

					<p class="faq_question">Can a group manager delegate the on-call scheduling to someone else?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">A group manager can setup "Shift managers" from within the group membership who can manage that going 
						forward, but the Shift Managers must be individuals from within that group.</p>
					<p class="faq_question">Will the group manager of every group be able to set up the on-call for their support group?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">TGroup Managers will be able to set up On-Call.</p>
					<p class="faq_question">Is the ability to setup monthly rotations available?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">The tool doesn’t have monthly rotation. There are daily or weekly rotations. </p>
					<p class="faq_question">Can a user override who was scheduled for a shift?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">Only the Group Manager can override.  </p>

				<div class="em-c-accordion__body">
					<p class="faq_question">Does an incident record need to exist before a problem record can be created?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">It isn’t mandatory, but you have option to link the incident to the problem record. </p>
					<p class="faq_question">Are problem tickets ebonded?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">No, problem records will not be e-bonded.</p>
					<p class="faq_question">Can users only create the problem records and assign it to the groups that they are part of?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">Yes, that is correct.</p>
					<p class="faq_question">Are you required to create a problem ticket every time an incident occurs?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">Creating a problem record is required for Major Incidents. For all other Incidents, 
						it is not mandatory, though encouraged. </p>
					<p class="faq_question">In ITSM we create work orders for a permanent fix for a recurring issue. Will we create incident tickets moving forward?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">To implement a permanent fix for an issue, user should raise a Normal Change (or Emergency Change – only if the issue is
					in progress and a high/critical priority incident is tagged). In the change record, user can relate the incident ticket under “Related Incidents”
					or vice versa (in incident ticket – change can be tagged as Fix Change Request). For Recurring issues, a problem ticket should be created and a
					change to resolve the issue should be mentioned in the problem ticket.</p>
					<p class="faq_question">Will the sequence of events in ServiceNow replace the Sequence of Events in the Major Incident template?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">That is the intent with which that functionality was built in ServiceNow. It will allow users to export that sequence 
						of events in a report as well. </p>
					<p class="faq_question">In BMC you can create a problem record from an incident and some information is copied. (CIs, notes, etc). When you create a related problem from an incident is anything copied?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">The information that gets copied over is CI, Service, Priority, Short Description,
						Description and Coordinator Group.</p>
					<p class="faq_question">If users need to input impacted applications, would they use the affected CIs in that case?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">The problem ticket has 2 fields at the bottom of the page – Impacted Services and Affected CIs tabs.
					For Applications that were impacted by the issue, will be mentioned under Impacted Services. For Cis that were affected
					not only by the issue but also maybe during investigation or post resolution implementation, those CIs will be updated
					under Affected CIs tab. Since the Impacted Services addition is only possible through Unique IDs of CIs; current practical
					approach can be an update to the Affected CIs with the necessary information.</p>
					<p class="faq_question">Does anything need to be done to the existing PBIs that are still active? Will they need to be recreated?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">If they are still active and being pursued in ITSM, then they will have to be 
						recreated in ServiceNow. </p>

					<p class="faq_question">People are using work orders and adhoc approvals in BMC today. Can you share what that looks like in SN and where to add approvals?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">Approvals for the RITM are included in the flow designer for the workflow. Which will 
						automatically create the approval tasks corresponding to the RITM. we have so far 
						not enabled ad-hoc approval process for the RITMs.</p>
					<p class="faq_question">If an approver is added at the request (RITM) level, how do you know that the approver has received the approval request?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">Notifications for approvers are automatically enabled in production for all ServiceNow users, if the approver didn't disable
					it on his/her profile it will be received via e-mail. If the approver says no e-mail was received inform L1 ServiceNow Admin team to check.</p>
					<p class="faq_question">What capability in ServiceNow replaces the work order functionality in BMC?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">Service Requests(RITMs).</p>
					<p class="faq_question">Does the parent request of a work order correspond to the Requested Item (RITM) in ServiceNow</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">Yes, that is correct.</p>
					<p class="faq_question">When does a service task (SCTASK) get created? Does it wait until the approval is granted?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">The SCTASK is created after the approval process is completed. Some items may not require
					approval hence the SCTASK will be created along with the service request (RITM).</p>
					<p class="faq_question">Can approvals for service requests be done from the portal?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">Approvals for Service Requests can be done from the portal . Please visit <a href= "https://goto/approvals" >Approvals</a></p>

					<p class="faq_question">Can a Service Request (RITM) be reopened after its completion?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">No, it’s not possible to reopen a RITM. The alternative is to create an incident via Service Portal which will be linked to it.</p>

					<p class="faq_answer">Yes, EMIT users with access to native view may add additional approvers either at Service Request (RITM) or Service Task (SCTASK) level.</p>
					<p class="faq_question">Is it possible to remove / replace approvers after the approval request was sent?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">No, it’s not possible to do it due to audit purposes. The best approach is to cancel the request and open a new one with the correct approver(s).</p>
					<p class="faq_question">Is it possible to link a Service Task (SCTASK) to another Service Task?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">No, it’s not possible, as SCTASK is the lowest hierarchical level records in ServiceNow.</p>

					<p class="faq_question">My Service Request (RITM) is not assigned to anyone, how can I check its status?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer">Usually RITMs are not assigned to individuals / analysts, only SCTASKs. You can check if there are any SCTASKs related to the RITM on “My Requests” session on Service Portal, selecting the RITM you want and check the tab “Associated Tasks”	<p>
					<p class="faq_question">Which form should I use to create a generic request, like “Create Work Order” in ITConsole?</p>

					open to all users, and IT4IT catalog, which contains forms to be used exclusively by users who are part of an assignment group (i.e. users with ITIL role).</p>
